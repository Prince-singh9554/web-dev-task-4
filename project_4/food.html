    <h1>Food</h1>
    <p>
        Indian food is a rich and diverse cuisine, known for its bold flavors, aromatic spices, and unique cooking techniques.
        The cuisine varies widely by region, with staples like rice and wheat being central to most meals. 
        North Indian dishes often feature dairy products like paneer and ghee, and are known for their hearty gravies and breads such as naan and roti. 
        South Indian cuisine, on the other hand, is predominantly rice-based and incorporates coconut, tamarind, and mustard seeds, with dishes like dosa, idli, and sambar being staples. 
        Western India blends both vegetarian and non-vegetarian flavors, with famous dishes like pav bhaji and Goan fish curry, while Eastern Indian cuisine is heavily influenced by rice, fish, and mustard oil, with dishes like macher jhol and pakhala bhata. 
        Indian food also includes a wide array of street foods, such as pani puri and samosas, and rich, indulgent sweets like gulab jamun, jalebi, and kheer. The use of fresh spices, herbs, and locally sourced ingredients makes Indian food not just a feast for the taste buds, but also an integral part of the country's cultural identity.
