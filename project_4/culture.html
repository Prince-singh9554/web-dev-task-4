        <h2>Music and Dance</h2>
        <p>
            India has a rich and varied tradition of classical music and dance, which plays an integral role in the culture.

Sitar, tabla, and flute are common instruments used in Indian classical music.
            India also has a long tradition of dance forms, each unique to different regions and communities. Classical dance forms like Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu), Kathak (North India), Kathakali (Kerala), Odissi (Odisha), and Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh) are renowned for their intricate movements, storytelling, and deep cultural significance. Folk dances like Garba, Bhangra, and Ghoomar are also widely performed during festivals and celebrations.

Each region has its distinct culinary traditions. In the north, dishes like butter chicken, dal makhani, and naan are popular, while in the south, dosa, idli, and sambar dominate. The west is known for dishes like pav bhaji and dal baati churma, while the east is famous for fish curry, momos, and mishti (sweets).
            Vegetarianism is common in India, especially among Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Many of India’s vegetarian dishes are rich in legumes, grains, and vegetables, making them highly nutritious.

        <h2>Family and Social Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Family plays a central role in Indian culture, with strong bonds between parents, children, and extended family members. Traditionally, the joint family system, where multiple generations live together, was prevalent, though nuclear families are becoming more common in urban areas. Respect for elders is deeply ingrained, and children are often expected to care for their aging parents.
            The caste system, though officially abolished, continues to influence social dynamics in some areas. However, urbanization and modernization have led to gradual changes in traditional social structures, with increasing focus on education, economic opportunities, and social mobility.

        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional Indian clothing varies by region and occasion. In the north and west, women often wear saris, a long piece of cloth wrapped around the body, while in the south, saris are often worn with a blouse and petticoat. Salwar kameez, a tunic worn with loose pants, is also popular. Men typically wear kurta-pajamas or sherwanis for formal occasions. However, Western-style clothing like jeans, shirts, and dresses is common, especially in urban areas.
